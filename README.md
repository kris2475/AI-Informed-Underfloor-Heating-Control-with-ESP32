# AI-Informed-Underfloor-Heating-Control-with-ESP32
This project develops a proactive AI model for a custom underfloor heating system on an ESP32. Using a benchtop model with a Kapton heater and aluminium block to simulate thermal inertia, it anticipates heating needs and optimises energy, moving beyond conventional reactive control.
